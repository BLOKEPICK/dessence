            <p>
              I’m Yanixza Morales, a Board-Certified Family Nurse Practitioner and the proud founder of D-Essence Wellness MedSpa in New Windsor, NY. My nursing journey began in 2007 when I earned my Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN). Years later, I completed a Master’s in Nursing with an emphasis in Education, inspired by my passion for teaching, mentoring, and leading others in the healthcare field. Soon after, I became a Family Nurse Practitioner, combining advanced medical training with a holistic and compassionate approach to patient care.
            </p>
            <p>
              With over 20 years of experience in healthcare, my background includes critical care, general medicine, hospice, and pediatrics. I have also led clinical teams and educated nurses, helping to improve quality standards and empower others to grow in their professional practice. These experiences have strengthened my belief that care goes beyond treatment—it’s about trust, education, and making every patient feel valued.
            </p>
            <p>
              At D-Essence Wellness, my mission is to help others look and feel their best through safe, effective, and evidence-based wellness and aesthetic treatments. Every service is guided by clinical excellence, integrity, and genuine care for each individual’s goals and well-being.
