Most patients schedule maintenance every 3\u20134 months. Your plan is tailored based on your goals, anatomy, and how quickly you metabolize the product."}, {"heading": "What to expect", "body": "Typical appointments last 15\u201325 minutes.

You can return to most normal activities right away; avoid strenuous exercise and lying flat for several hours as advised by your provider."}, {"heading": "Pre\u2011 & aftercare basics", "body": "Before: arrive with clean skin; consider pausing blood\u2011thinning supplements if approved by your physician.

You may experience small bumps or redness that resolve quickly."}, {"q": "Can neurotoxins be combined with other treatments?", "a": "Yes\u2014often paired with fillers, microneedling, or peels for comprehensive rejuvenation. We\u2019ll design a sequence that fits your timeline."}, {"q": "Who is not a candidate?", "a": "Those who are pregnant or breastfeeding, have certain neuromuscular conditions, or allergies to ingredients should avoid treatment. We\u2019ll review your medical history during consultation."}];
