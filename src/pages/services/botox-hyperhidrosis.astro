        <p class="mt-3 muted dropcap">
          Hyperhidrosis is a condition where the body sweats excessively beyond what is needed for temperature regulation. Botox works by temporarily blocking the nerve signals that stimulate sweat glands, reducing sweat production in the treated area.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3 muted">
          This localized treatment provides months of relief and is FDA-approved for underarm sweating, with off-label use in other areas. It significantly improves comfort and quality of life for patients struggling with uncontrollable sweating.
