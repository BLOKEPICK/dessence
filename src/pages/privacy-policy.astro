      <!-- Cookies -->
      <h3 class="mt-6 text-base font-medium">Cookies</h3>
      <p class="mt-2 text-neutral-700">
        We use “cookies” on this site. A cookie is a piece of data stored on a site visitor’s device to help us improve
        access to our site and identify repeat visitors. Cookies can enable us to track and target user interests to
        enhance the experience on our site. Some business partners may also use cookies (for example, advertisers).
        However, we have no access to or control over these cookies. We do not honor the Do Not Track (DNT) browser
        preference at this time.
      </p>

      <!-- How We Use the Information -->
      <h2 class="mt-10 text-xl font-semibold">How We Use the Information We Collect</h2>
      <p class="mt-2 text-neutral-700">
        We use your information to monitor and improve our services. For example, we use Google Analytics to help analyze
        how our users utilize this website. Google Analytics uses cookies to collect information such as how often users
        visit the site, what pages they visit, and what other sites they used prior to coming here. Google Analytics
        collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit, rather than your name or other personally
        identifying information. We do not combine information generated via Google Analytics with your personal
        information. Google’s ability to use and share information about your visits is restricted by the Google Analytics
        Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-3 text-neutral-700">
        We use your personal information to respond to your inquiries—typically to inform you about products and services
        we offer. We may share your personal information with third-party providers outside of our organization, if
        necessary, to fulfill your request (e.g., to ship an order) or to help manage our website.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-3 text-neutral-700">
        Unless you opt out, we may contact you via email in the future to tell you about specials or new products or
        services. We may share aggregated (non-identifiable) demographic information with partners and advertisers. We may
        use outside companies to ship orders and to process payments; these companies do not retain or use personal
        information for secondary purposes beyond fulfilling your order. We may partner with other parties to provide
        specific services and will share only the information necessary for them to provide those services.
      </p>

      <!-- Security -->
      <h2 class="mt-10 text-xl font-semibold">How We Protect the Information We Collect</h2>
      <h3 class="mt-4 text-base font-medium">Security</h3>
      <p class="mt-2 text-neutral-700">
        We employ reasonable technical and organizational safeguards designed to protect your information from
        unauthorized access, loss, misuse, or alteration. We store personal information on secure (password- and
        firewall-protected) servers, and only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (e.g., billing
        or customer service) are granted access. The computers/servers in which we store personal information are kept in
        a secure environment.
      </p>

      <!-- Compliance with Law -->
      <h3 class="mt-6 text-base font-medium">Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement</h3>
      <p class="mt-2 text-neutral-700">
        We may disclose personal information, usage data, and other information if reasonably necessary to: (a) satisfy
        any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; (b) enforce a contract, including
        investigation of potential violations; (c) detect, prevent, or address fraud, security, or technical issues; or
        (d) protect against harm to the rights, property, or safety of our website, its users, or the public.
      </p>

      <!-- Location / Storage -->
      <h3 class="mt-6 text-base font-medium">Your Information May Be Maintained Within the United States</h3>
      <p class="mt-2 text-neutral-700">
        We process and store information in the United States. By using the website, you agree that the collection, use,
        transfer, and disclosure of your information and communications will be governed by U.S. law. All data we collect
        is stored on servers in the United States. When we transfer data out of the European Economic Area or Switzerland,
        we use appropriate legal mechanisms (e.g., standard contractual clauses, binding corporate rules, or other lawful
        bases).
      </p>

      <!-- Misc -->
      <h2 class="mt-10 text-xl font-semibold">Miscellaneous</h2>
      <h3 class="mt-4 text-base font-medium">Links</h3>
      <p class="mt-2 text-neutral-700">

      <h3 class="mt-6 text-base font-medium">Surveys &amp; Contests</h3>
      <p class="mt-2 text-neutral-700">
        Participation in surveys or contests is voluntary. Information requested may include contact details and
        demographic information. Contact information is used to notify winners and award prizes; survey information is
        used to monitor or improve the site.

      <h3 class="mt-6 text-base font-medium">Updates</h3>
      <p class="mt-2 text-neutral-700">
        Our privacy policy may change from time to time. Changes become effective upon posting on this page (see the
        revision date above). Use of information we collect now is subject to the policy in effect at the time such
        information is collected. By continuing to use the website and our services, you agree to be bound by the revised
        policy.

        We retain information only for so long as it continues to help us monitor or improve the services. When personal
        information or usage data is no longer needed, it will be deleted or anonymized.
      </p>
