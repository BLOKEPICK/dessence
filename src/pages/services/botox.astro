        We take a consultation‑first approach, mapping your goals and anatomy and crafting a plan that aims for subtle, natural‑looking results.
        Each step is explained with clarity—what the service addresses, how it works, and what you can expect before, during, and after treatment.
      </p>
      <p class="text-white/80">
        Comfort, safety, and transparency guide our process. Techniques, products, and device settings are selected thoughtfully,
        with an emphasis on balanced outcomes and a refined finish—not an overdone look.
