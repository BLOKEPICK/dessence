      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">Appointment Policy</h2>
      <div class="mt-3 rounded-2xl bg-neutral-50 ring-1 ring-neutral-200 p-5 text-sm text-neutral-700">
        <p>
          To ensure that you get an appointment for the date and time you desire, we suggest booking all appointments a few weeks in advance.
          Our website displays the most up-to-date availability. Please note that we require a credit card to reserve your appointment.
        </p>

      <!-- Consultations Policy -->
      <h2 class="mt-10 text-xl font-semibold">Consultations Policy</h2>
      <p class="mt-2 text-neutral-700">
        We provide consultations and in-depth skin analysis with one of our expert providers. We believe an informed client with realistic
        expectations will be most satisfied with our treatments and results. Our consultations include education about your unique skin type,
        a comprehensive discussion about all options available to you (both immediate and long term), and a clear plan of action based on your
        individual goals.
      </p>

      <!-- Cancellation Policy -->
      <h2 class="mt-10 text-xl font-semibold">Cancellation Policy</h2>
      <p class="mt-2 text-neutral-700">
        As a courtesy to our providers, for non-group appointments, please provide a minimum of twenty-four (24) hours notice should you need
        to cancel or reschedule an appointment. You will be charged <strong>$100</strong> if an appointment is canceled or rescheduled less than
        twenty-four (24) hours in advance or if there is a no-show.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-3 text-neutral-700">
        For group appointments, there is a seventy two (72) hour cancellation policy, and the credit card on file will be charged
        <strong>$200</strong> if canceled less than seventy two (72) hours in advance.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-3 text-neutral-700">
        If you arrive more than ten (10) minutes late for your appointment, you may be required to reschedule to avoid disrupting other
        clients’ appointments.
      </p>
